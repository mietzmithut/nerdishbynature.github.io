**Gitlab:Issues** is a [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/) client that connects you directly to your projects and especially your Issues, while you are on the go.

This app let's you do everything you can do in the browser when you edit or create issues:

This includes:

* create new issues
* assign existing ones to other contributers
* you are able to post comments
* and close issues

Search your repositiories and get everything on one view with the Dashboard.

**Gitlab:Issues** is the perfect mobile buddy that your [GitLab](http://gitlab.org/) ever wanted.

**Gitlab:Issues** is completely open source.
