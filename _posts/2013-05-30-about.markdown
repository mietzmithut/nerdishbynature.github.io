My name is Piet Brauer and I live in Leipzig, Germany. I am an iOS developer available for hire.

I started programing in school at the age of 18 using Delphi, PHP and HTML. 
But after the first iOS SDK was released I discovered mobile applications and got stuck on them until now.

In my free time I got my hands on the popular Ruby frameworks Ruby on Rails and Sinatra and got introduced to Test-Driven-Development and REST APIs.
