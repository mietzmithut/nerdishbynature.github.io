I am developing iOS apps since 2009. And I developed over 15 apps that are available through the App Store.

All apps were developed using the native iOS SDK and often a JSON or XML API.

If you want me to work on a project of your own just drop me an [email](mailto:info@nerdishbynature.com) or contact me via [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Piet_Brauer) or [Linkedin](http://lnkd.in/ZcFqRe).

I am offering the following services:

* development of your own projects and ideas
* updates on existing projects
* consultation on iOS apps considering proof of concept and UX
* developing dummy applications using Rubymotion
